### A little bit about me
Currenty I work as a head of exotic destiantions department in ukrainian tour operator. During this  ~~russian special operation~~ **russian invasion** I understood that I need a more reliable job and I had always dreamed to be a part of the video game industry, so I decided to study at **WebAcademy**. Hope that one day it will help me to join **Riot Games team**.

In my spare time, I like chilling with my friends, reading science-fiction books, watching anime, fantasy series, and movies, and playing video games. Also **one of the most important parts of my life - is helping homeless animals**:broken_heart: (hope that one day I will open my own shelter or better if every single pet finds the owner).
